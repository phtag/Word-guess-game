The web page for the Word Guess Game provides the user with a game in which they attempt to guess the name of the city whose picture is curently displayed. City pictures are displayed on the left section of the page and the right section provides a scoreboard where the letters of the city name are displayed. Initially, the letters for the city are all displayed as dashes. The use types in individual letters from their keyboard. For each city, the user is permitted only 5 incorrect letter guesses. Correctly guessed letters become displayed in the city name section of the scoreboard. Incorrectly guessed letters cause the number of guesses remaining to be decremented by one. When the remaining number of guesses becomes zero, the user loses the game and is provided with an opportinity to play another game. A sound-bite is played when the user loses or wins a game. Clicking on the displayed button forces a new game to be played and a new city picture is displayed to start the game.
